# ocx-theme-components

Every component ships as Astro source in `@ocx-sh/theme`. Import it by its
file path under `components/`:

```mdx
import Button from '@ocx-sh/theme/components/ui/Button.astro';
import Tabs from '@ocx-sh/theme/components/Tabs.astro';
import TabItem from '@ocx-sh/theme/components/TabItem.astro';
import { toast } from '@ocx-sh/theme/toast';
```

Setup (the Starlight plugin) is `ocx-theme-setup` at
`../ocx-theme-setup/SKILL.md`; colours and tokens are `ocx-theme-theming` at
`../ocx-theme-theming/SKILL.md`. Missing either? Install the set:
`grim add ghcr.io/ocx-sh/lore/ocx-theme:latest`.

## Rules every component follows

1. **First paint is final.** The server renders every part in its final state:
   selected tab, open item, checked box, sorted rows. Pass initial state as
   props (`value`, `open`, `expanded`, `sort`) and never fix it up in a
   client script. A script that moves content after load is a layout-shift bug.
2. **Nothing loads before interaction.** A Zag-backed component loads its
   machine on the first hover, focus or touch of its root. Exceptions: `Toc`
   starts when it scrolls into view; search, the toaster and the mobile menu
   start on demand; a `Dialog` or `Drawer` rendered `open` starts at once.
   Never import `@zag-js/*` in page code. Details:
   [references/loading-model.md](references/loading-model.md).
3. **An accessible name is required, and the types enforce it.** `label` is a
   required prop on every field, group, list and meter. `iconOnly` on Button
   and ToggleButton requires `aria-label`. A removable Tag requires
   `removeLabel`. Use `hideLabel` to hide a label visually, never to drop it.
4. **The `zag` prop is data only.** It passes extra machine props through
   (`zag={{ loopFocus: false }}`). Functions and ids are rejected by its type;
   listen to the component's DOM event instead.
5. **Events are DOM events named `ocx:<component>:<event>`** and bubble, e.g.
   `ocx:select:change` with `detail.value`. Listen on the component or the
   document.
6. **Accent is reserved** for links, the current item, the one primary action
   per view and focus. `variant="primary"` once per view; status uses `tone`.

import them from `@astrojs/starlight/components` as usual.

## Choosing between neighbours

| Need | Use | Not |
|---|---|---|
| Navigate somewhere | `Link`, or `Button href` for a call to action | `Button` with a click handler |
| Choose one of 2 to 5 visible options | `ToggleGroup` (UI state) or `RadioGroup` (form field) | `Select` |
| Choose one of many | `Select` (fixed list) or `Combobox` (type to filter) | `RadioGroup` |
| Explain a term in running text | `Tooltip` | `Hint` |
| Name an icon-only button | `Hint` around the button, plus its `aria-label` | `Tooltip` |
| Links in a dropdown | `Menu` | `ActionMenu` |
| Commands in a dropdown | `ActionMenu` | `Menu` |
| Ask yes or no | `ConfirmDialog` | a custom `Dialog` |
| Static file listing | `Tree` | `TreeView` |
| Value in a range | `Meter` | `ProgressCircle` |
| Task progress | `ProgressCircle`, or a `loading` toast | `Meter` |
| Tabular data a page passes in | `DataTable` | a Markdown table (stays static) |

## Compound components

`Tabs` / `TabItem` and `Accordion` / `AccordionItem` pass parent state by
post-processing the rendered slot HTML, not by context: MDX renders children
before their parent. Put the items directly inside their parent, give each
`AccordionItem` a slug-like unique `value`, and never wrap items in another
component.

## Before you ship a page

- Initial state set by props, nothing corrected by a script after load.
- Each field, group and icon-only control has its accessible name.
- One `variant="primary"` per view at most.
- A reserved box for anything that loads late (`Skeleton`, `Terminal` with
  `cols` and `rows`, images with width and height).
- No `@zag-js/*` import and no inline `style` colour in page code.
